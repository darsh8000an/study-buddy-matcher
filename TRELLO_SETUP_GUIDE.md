# üìã Trello Board Setup Guide - Study Buddy Matcher

## üöÄ COMPLETE BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO TRELLO

### **What is Trello?**
Trello is a visual project management tool that uses **boards**, **lists**, and **cards** to organize tasks.

Think of it like sticky notes on a whiteboard:
- **Board** = The whiteboard (your project)
- **Lists** = Columns on the whiteboard (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- **Cards** = Individual sticky notes (tasks)
