## Quick Start Guide

### Running the Backend

1. **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

2. **Set Up Environment:**
```bash
# Copy .env.example to .env
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings
```

3. **Start MongoDB:**
```bash
# Option 1: Local MongoDB
mongod

# Option 2: Docker
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:latest
```

4. **Start Backend:**
```bash
npm run dev  # Development mode with nodemon
# OR
npm start    # Production mode
```

Backend will be available at http://localhost:5000

### Using Docker

```bash
# From project root
docker-compose up --build
```

This starts both MongoDB and backend in containers.

### Testing the API

Use Postman or curl to test endpoints:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Register user
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "university": "Deakin University",
    "degree": "Bachelor of IT",
    "yearOfStudy": 2
  }'
```
