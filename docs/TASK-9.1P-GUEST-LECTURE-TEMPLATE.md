## Example Reflection

*Christian Vecchiola's lecture provided valuable insights into industry software development practices at IBM. His emphasis on collaborative development, version control, and continuous integration resonates with our Study Buddy Matcher project approach. We're already implementing Git workflows and Docker containerization, which align with industry standards he discussed. The importance of testing and code reviews highlighted in the lecture reinforced our Sprint 2 focus on comprehensive testing coverage. His real-world examples of large-scale system architecture gave me perspective on scalability considerations. This knowledge will guide my professional development, emphasizing not just writing code, but building maintainable, collaborative, and scalable software systems.*
